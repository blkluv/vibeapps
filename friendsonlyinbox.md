# Inbox Messaging System PRD

## Overview

This PRD defines one to one direct messages with opt-in inbox control. The inbox icon is always visible on all user profiles next to the follow button. Each user controls whether their inbox is enabled or disabled via a toggle on their own profile. Messaging is available to anyone when the recipient's inbox is enabled, regardless of follow status. The feature integrates with existing VibeApps stack (Clerk auth, Convex backend, alerts, Resend emails) with comprehensive rate limiting and admin moderation.

## Why this matters

User-controlled inbox availability creates a clear consent gate that reduces spam while remaining open and accessible. Users decide who can message them by toggling their inbox on or off. Rate limiting prevents abuse. Admin moderation handles reports without compromising user privacy. The always-visible inbox icon creates discoverability while maintaining user control.

- `dmReports`: message and user reports with status tracking
- `dmRateLimits`: track hourly and daily message counts
- `users.inboxEnabled`: boolean flag (default true)

## Rollout Plan

1. Backend Foundation: schema, server functions
2. Rate Limiting & Settings: admin configuration
3. UI Implementation: profile updates, inbox page
4. Admin Moderation: dashboard and reporting
5. Email Integration: daily digest, report emails
6. Testing & Optimization: end-to-end validation
