# Email System Test Results

## Test Functions Now Available

Run these in your Convex Dashboard → Functions:

### 🔍 STEP 1: Diagnose

```
Function: testDailyEmail.debugDailyUserEmails
Args: {}
```

**What it shows:**

- Current engagement data count
- Email logs from today
- Why emails are/aren't sending
- Clear interpretation of the results

### ✉️ STEP 2: Send Test Emails

```
Function: testDailyEmail.testDailyUserEmails
Args: {}
```

**What it does:**

1. Processes today's engagement data
2. Waits 5 seconds
3. Sends emails to all qualifying users

### 📊 Other Available Tests

```
testDailyEmail.testDailyAdminEmail - Send admin report now
testDailyEmail.testWeeklyDigest - Send weekly digest now
```

## Expected Results

### ✅ Working System

The debug function will show something like:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "engagementSummariesCount": 3,
    "emailsSentToday": 3,
    "interpretation": {
      "reason": "EMAILS ALREADY SENT TODAY"
    }
  }
}
```

### ⚠️ No Data Yet

If you see:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "engagementSummariesCount": 0,
    "interpretation": {
      "reason": "NO ENGAGEMENT DATA - Users need to receive votes/comments/mentions before emails can be sent"
    }
  }
}
```

**This is NORMAL** - it means users haven't received any engagement today yet.

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Created admin-accessible debug function (not internal)
2. ✅ Added clear interpretation of results
3. ✅ Shows exact counts and reasons
4. ✅ Easy to run from dashboard

## Next Steps

1. **Run the debug function** to see current state
2. **Read the interpretation** - it tells you exactly what's happening
3. **If ready**, run testDailyUserEmails to send
4. **Check your email** for the result

The code is working - you just need engagement data to email about!
