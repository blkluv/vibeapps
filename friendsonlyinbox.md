# Inbox Messaging System PRD

## Overview

This PRD defines one to one direct messages with opt-in inbox control. The inbox icon is always visible on all user profiles next to the follow button. Each user controls whether their inbox is enabled or disabled via a toggle on their own profile. Messaging is available to anyone when the recipient's inbox is enabled, regardless of follow status. The feature integrates with existing VibeApps stack (Clerk auth, Convex backend, alerts, Resend emails) with comprehensive rate limiting and admin moderation.

## Why this matters

User-controlled inbox availability creates a clear consent gate that reduces spam while remaining open and accessible. Users decide who can message them by toggling their inbox on or off. Rate limiting prevents abuse. Admin moderation handles reports without compromising user privacy. The always-visible inbox icon creates discoverability while maintaining user control.

## Scope

- Admin moderation dashboard for reported messages and users
- Admins cannot see messages unless reported
- Users can report messages or users within inbox
- Reports trigger immediate email to admins and managers
- Alerts fire on new inbox messages for recipient

## User stories

### User Experience

- As a logged in user I see an Inbox icon on all user profiles including my own next to the follow button
- As a logged in user I see an inbox toggle on my own profile (to the right of inbox icon) to enable or disable my inbox
- As a logged in user viewing another profile, I see their inbox icon grayed out if disabled, black if enabled
- As a logged in user I see a Message button on profiles where the user has their inbox enabled (regardless of follow status)
- As a logged in user I can click Message to open or create a conversation with that user if their inbox is enabled
- As a logged in user I can optionally reply to specific messages creating a thread
- As a logged in user I can use @mentions within my inbox messages
- As a logged in user I can delete my own messages (removes message from my view only)
- As a logged in user I can delete a conversation from my inbox (removes entire conversation from my view only)
- As a logged in user I can clear my entire inbox (removes all conversations from my view at once)
- As a logged in user I can report a message or user from within the inbox
- As a logged in user I receive an alert when someone sends me a message
- As a logged in user I see inbox activity mentioned in my daily engagement email (without message content shown)

### Admin Experience

- As an admin I can configure rate limits for messages (per hour per recipient, per day per user)
- As an admin I can view the inbox moderation dashboard showing only reported messages and users
- As an admin I cannot see user messages unless they have been reported
- As an admin I receive an immediate email when a message or user is reported
- As an admin I can review reports and take action (hide message, ban user, dismiss report)

## Data model

All tables are defined in `convex/schema.ts` with proper indexes and validators. Key additions:

- `dmConversations`: normalized pair structure (userAId, userBId)
- `dmMessages`: with optional parentMessageId for threading and deletedBy array for soft deletes
- `dmDeletedConversations`: track which users deleted which conversations (soft delete)
- `dmReads`: track last read time per user per conversation
- `dmReports`: message and user reports with status tracking
- `dmRateLimits`: track hourly and daily message counts
- `users.inboxEnabled`: boolean flag (default true)
- `appSettings`: admin-configurable rate limits
- `alerts`: new types "message" and "dm_report"

### Detailed Schema Definitions

- Add inbox toggle on own profile only (to right of icon)
- Add Message button conditionally (only if recipient inbox enabled)
- Remove mutual follow requirement

### Inbox Page `/inbox`

- Left: conversation list with unread counts
- Right: message thread with composer
- Threading: reply button creates parent-child relationship
- @mention: autocomplete when typing @
- Delete options: overflow menu on messages and conversations
- Clear inbox: button to delete all conversations at once (with confirmation)
- Report: overflow menu on messages
- Mobile: stack layout

### Frontend Components Structure

```
src/components/messages/
â”œâ”€â”€ ConversationList.tsx      # List of conversations with unread counts
â”œâ”€â”€ ConversationView.tsx      # Individual conversation interface
â”œâ”€â”€ MessageBubble.tsx         # Individual message component with delete option
â”œâ”€â”€ MessageInput.tsx          # Compose new message with @mention
â”œâ”€â”€ MessageThread.tsx         # Threaded reply view
â”œâ”€â”€ DeleteMessageModal.tsx    # Confirm message deletion
â”œâ”€â”€ DeleteConversationModal.tsx  # Confirm conversation deletion
â”œâ”€â”€ ClearInboxModal.tsx       # Confirm clearing entire inbox
â””â”€â”€ ReportMessageModal.tsx    # Report inappropriate message
```

### @Mention Integration

```typescript
// Use existing MentionTextarea component
import { MentionTextarea } from "../ui/MentionTextarea";

// In MessageInput.tsx
<MentionTextarea
  value={messageContent}
  onChange={setMessageContent}
  placeholder="Type a message... Use @username to mention someone"
  maxLength={2000}
  disabled={sending}
/>

// Process mentions on send
const handleSend = async () => {
  // Extract mentions using existing utility from mentions.ts
  const mentionedUsers = await extractMentions(messageContent);

  await sendMessage({
    conversationId,
    content: messageContent,
    mentionedUsers, // Will trigger mention notifications
  });
};
```

### Real-time Updates

```typescript
// Real-time conversation list (excludes deleted conversations)
const conversations = useQuery(
  api.dm.listConversations,
  isSignedIn ? {} : "skip",
);

// Real-time messages in conversation (excludes messages deleted by current user)
const messages = useQuery(
  api.dm.listMessages,
  selectedConversationId ? { conversationId: selectedConversationId } : "skip",
);

// Real-time unread count for badge
const unreadCount = useQuery(api.dm.getUnreadCount, isSignedIn ? {} : "skip");
```

### Deletion UI Patterns

```typescript
// MessageBubble.tsx - Delete own message
{isOwnMessage && (
  <button
    onClick={() => setShowDeleteModal(true)}
    className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-800">
    Delete
  </button>
)}

// ConversationList.tsx - Delete conversation
<button
  onClick={() => setShowDeleteConversationModal(true)}
  className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-800">
  Delete Conversation
</button>

// InboxHeader.tsx - Clear entire inbox
<button
  onClick={() => setShowClearInboxModal(true)}
  className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-800">
  Clear Inbox ({conversationCount})
</button>

// Confirmation modals show clear warnings
<DeleteMessageModal
  message="This will remove this message from your view. The other person will still see it."
  onConfirm={handleDelete}
/>

<ClearInboxModal
  message={`This will remove all ${count} conversations from your inbox. This cannot be undone.`}
  onConfirm={handleClearInbox}
/>
```

### Admin Dashboard `/admin/inbox-moderation`

- List reported messages and users
- Show report context and status
- Action buttons: dismiss, hide message, ban user
- No access to unreported messages

## Authorization and Privacy

- Only message when recipient inbox enabled
- Rate limiting enforced server-side
- Only participants can send/view messages
- Admins cannot see unreported messages
- All functions require authentication
- Convex reactivity for real-time sync

## Message and Conversation Deletion

### Deletion Behavior

All deletions are **soft deletes** that only affect the user's own view:

#### Message Deletion

- Users can delete their own messages only
- Deleted messages are removed from the deleting user's view
- Other participants still see the message normally
- `deletedBy` array tracks which users deleted the message
- Queries filter out messages where current user is in `deletedBy`
- Deleted messages remain in database for admin reports and moderation

#### Conversation Deletion

- Users can delete conversations from their inbox
- Deleted conversations are removed from the deleting user's conversation list
- Other participant still sees the conversation normally
- Record created in `dmDeletedConversations` table
- Queries filter out conversations deleted by current user
- New messages to deleted conversations will restore them in the user's inbox

#### Clear Inbox

- Batch operation to delete all conversations at once
- Creates `dmDeletedConversations` records for all active conversations
- Shows confirmation modal with count of conversations to be cleared
- Cannot be undone (user must wait for new messages to restore conversations)
- Does not affect other users' views of conversations

### Implementation Details

```typescript
// Delete message mutation
export const deleteMessage = mutation({
  args: { messageId: v.id("dmMessages") },
  returns: v.null(),
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");

    const message = await ctx.db.get(args.messageId);
    if (!message) throw new Error("Message not found");

    // Only sender can delete
    if (message.senderId !== identity.subject) {
      throw new Error("You can only delete your own messages");
    }

    // Add user to deletedBy array
    const deletedBy = message.deletedBy ?? [];
    await ctx.db.patch(args.messageId, {
      deletedBy: [...deletedBy, identity.subject],
    });

    return null;
  },
});

// Delete conversation mutation
export const deleteConversation = mutation({
  args: { conversationId: v.id("dmConversations") },
  returns: v.null(),
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");

    // Check if already deleted
    const existing = await ctx.db
      .query("dmDeletedConversations")
      .withIndex("by_conversation_user", (q) =>
        q
          .eq("conversationId", args.conversationId)
          .eq("userId", identity.subject),
      )
      .first();

    if (existing) return null; // Already deleted

    // Create deletion record
    await ctx.db.insert("dmDeletedConversations", {
      conversationId: args.conversationId,
      userId: identity.subject,
    });

    return null;
  },
});

// Clear inbox mutation
export const clearInbox = mutation({
  args: {},
  returns: v.object({ deletedCount: v.number() }),
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");

    // Get all active conversations
    const conversations = await ctx.db
      .query("dmConversations")
      .filter((q) =>
        q.or(
          q.eq(q.field("userAId"), identity.subject),
          q.eq(q.field("userBId"), identity.subject),
        ),
      )
      .collect();

    let deletedCount = 0;

    for (const conversation of conversations) {
      // Check if not already deleted
      const existing = await ctx.db
        .query("dmDeletedConversations")
        .withIndex("by_conversation_user", (q) =>
          q
            .eq("conversationId", conversation._id)
            .eq("userId", identity.subject),
        )
        .first();

      if (!existing) {
        await ctx.db.insert("dmDeletedConversations", {
          conversationId: conversation._id,
          userId: identity.subject,
        });
        deletedCount++;
      }
    }

    return { deletedCount };
  },
});
```

## Rate Limits

Admin configurable via `appSettings`:

- `dmHourlyLimitPerRecipient`: default 10 messages/hour per recipient
- `dmDailyLimitGlobal`: default 100 messages/day site-wide

Enforced before every message send with clear error messages.

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- **Message pagination**: Load messages in chunks of 50
- **Conversation virtualization**: Virtual scrolling for large conversation lists
- **Optimistic updates**: Immediate UI updates with error handling
- **Debounced typing**: Prevent excessive re-renders

### Real-time Features

- **Convex reactivity**: Automatic UI updates for new messages
- **Message delivery status**: Visual indicators for sent messages
- **Unread tracking**: Per-conversation read status
- **Live conversation updates**: Real-time last message and timestamp

### Data Management

- **Message retention**: Consider auto-delete after 1 year (configurable)
- **Text message limits**: 2000 characters per message
- **Rate limiting enforcement**: Server-side validation before every send
- **Conversation limits**: Monitor active conversation counts per user
- **Soft deletion**: Messages and conversations use soft deletes (per-user view only)
- **Query filtering**: All queries automatically filter deleted items for current user
- **Deletion cleanup**: Consider periodic cleanup of messages deleted by all participants
- **Restore on new message**: Deleted conversations automatically restore when new messages arrive

## Migration & Deployment

### Database Migration

1. **Schema deployment**: Add new tables to Convex schema
2. **Default settings**: Set `inboxEnabled: true` for existing users
3. **Index creation**: Ensure all required indexes are built
4. **Rate limit defaults**: Configure initial rate limits in appSettings

### Feature Rollout

1. **Admin testing**: Enable for admin users first
2. **Beta group**: Limited user testing for feedback
3. **Gradual rollout**: Percentage-based feature flags if needed
4. **Full deployment**: All users with monitoring
5. **Monitoring**: Track message volume, errors, and user adoption

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement

- **Inbox adoption**: Percentage of users with inbox enabled vs disabled
- **Daily active messengers**: Users sending or receiving messages daily
- **Messages per active user**: Average messages sent per active user
- **Conversation length**: Average number of messages per conversation
- **Return rate**: Users returning to messaging feature within 7 days
- **Deletion rates**: Percentage of messages deleted, conversations deleted, inbox clears
- **Conversation restoration**: How often deleted conversations are restored by new messages

### Privacy & Safety

- **Rate limit effectiveness**: Percentage of users hitting rate limits
- **Report response time**: Average time to resolve message reports
- **Report volume**: Number of reports per 1000 messages
- **Admin action rate**: Percentage of reports resulting in action (hide/ban)
- **User blocking**: Adoption of inbox disable feature

### Technical Performance

- **Message delivery time**: Real-time latency for message delivery
- **Query performance**: Database query response times
- **Uptime**: System availability for messaging features
- **Error rates**: Message send/receive failure rates
- **Pagination performance**: Load time for conversation and message lists
